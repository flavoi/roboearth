roboearth
=========

This is a porting of the original stack to ROS Fuerte. It has been used in my master thesis on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

The goal of the RoboEarth project is to build up huge common knowledge bases for robotic systems, which will allow them to reliably identify objects, improve their actions over time and adapt their navigation strategies for unknown environments, which they were not explicitly planned for at design time.
